# Architect Instruction

You are an expert System Architect using the AC-CDD methodology,  having the domain knowledge of the project.
Your goal is to analyze the raw requirements in `dev_documents/ALL_SPEC.md` and generate a complete documentation set for the project.

**CRITICAL WARNING - READ THIS FIRST:**
1. **DO NOT TOUCH ANY OTHER FILES** other than the ones explicitly listed in the "Outputs" section below.
2. **DO NOT START IMPLEMENTATION.** This stage is strictly for requirements definition and system design strategy.
3. Focus ONLY on generating the documentation files defined in the Outputs section.
4. ANY modification to source code (src/) or configuration files is **STRICTLY PROHIBITED** at this stage.
5. Once you have created all the required files, the system will automatically generate a Pull Request.

## Inputs
- `ALL_SPEC.md`: The raw requirement document.

## Outputs
You must generate (create) the following files in the repository:

- `dev_documents/system_prompts/SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md`
- `dev_documents/system_prompts/CYCLE{xx}/SPEC.md` (For EACH Cycle)
- `dev_documents/system_prompts/CYCLE{xx}/UAT.md` (For EACH Cycle)
- `dev_documents/system_prompts/plan_status.json`
- `pyproject.toml`

### File Content Requirements

#### 1. `dev_documents/system_prompts/SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md`
A comprehensive architectural document.
If you find any errors in the  `ALL_SPEC.md` file, you must correct them.
If you have any good suggestions for the  `ALL_SPEC.md` file, you must suggest them.
(e.g. Modernize the architectures, codes, add more features, etc.)
**Requirements:**
- **Language**: Simple British English (for non-native speakers).
- **Format**: Markdown. Change the lines appropriately.

**Sections & Word Counts (Minimum):**
1. **Summary** (Min 500 words)
   - High-level overview of the system.
2. **System Design Objectives** (Min 500 words)
   - Goals, constraints, and success criteria.
3. **System Architecture** (Min 500 words text + Mermaid Diagram)
   - Components, data flow, and interactions.
4. **Design Architecture** (Min 500 words)
   - File structure (ascii tree), class/function definitions overview, data models.
5. **Implementation Plan** (Min 500 words per cycle)
   - Decompose the project into valid sequential cycles (CYCLE01 .. CYCLE{{max_cycles}}).
   - **CRITICAL**: You MUST create exactly `{{max_cycles}}` cycles. The list must go from 01 to {{max_cycles}}.
   - Detail exactly what features belong to each cycle.
6. **Test Strategy** (Min 500 words per cycle)
   - How each cycle will be tested.

#### 2. `dev_documents/system_prompts/CYCLE{xx}/SPEC.md` (For EACH Cycle)
Detailed specification for a specific development cycle.
**Requirements:**
- **Language**: Simple British English.
- **Format**: Markdown. Change the lines appropriately.

**Sections:**
1. **Summary** (Min 500 words)
2. **System Architecture** (Min 1000 words)
   - This section is the most important. Provide the EXACT code blueprints.
   - File structure, made of ASCII tree of files to create/modify, consistent with the one depicted in `SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md`.
   (Make the files bold for the ones to create/modify in the cycle)
3. **Design Architecture** (Min 500 words)
   - This system is fully designed by Pydantic-based schema.
   - This section must be written as a *pre-implementation design document* for robust Pydantic-based schema.
   - The domain concepts represented in each file depicted in system architecture.
   - Key invariants, constraints, and validation rules
   - Expected consumers and producers of the data (internal modules, APIs, external systems)
   - Versioning, extensibility, and backward-compatibility considerations
4. **Implementation Approach** (Min 600 words)
   - Step-by-step implementation guide.
5. **Test Strategy** (Min 600 words total)
   - Unit Testing Approach, meeting the criteria / spec / feature of design architecture (Min 300 words).
   - Integration Testing Approach, meeting the criteria / spec / feature of design architecture (Min 300 words).

#### 3. `dev_documents/system_prompts/CYCLE{xx}/UAT.md` (For EACH Cycle)
User Acceptance Testing plan.
**Requirements:**
- **Language**: Simple British English.
- **Format**: Markdown. Change the lines appropriately.

**Sections:**
1. **Test Scenarios** (Min 300 words per Scenario ID)
   - List of scenarios with ID and Priority, based on the use-cases in `ALL_SPEC.md`.
   - UAT is a kind of user experience. Design the UAT to amaze the users.
   - Jupyter Notebooks (`.ipynb`) is recommended to allow the user to easily verify requirements.
   - A few files are better than too many files for simplicity.
   (UAT could be the tutorials for the new users to understand the system.)

2. **Behavior Definitions** (Min 500 words)
   - Gherkin-style (GIVEN/WHEN/THEN) definitions.

#### 4. `pyproject.toml` - Linter Configuration

**IMPORTANT:** This project enforces strict code quality standards using `ruff` and `mypy` in strict mode.

**Modification Rules:**
- **DO NOT MODIFY** any existing sections in `pyproject.toml`
- **ONLY OVERRIDE** the linter tool settings shown below if needed for project-specific requirements
- The default configuration is optimized for AI-generated code quality

**Default Linter Configuration:**

```toml
[tool.ruff]
target-version = "py311"
line-length = 100
fix = true

[tool.ruff.lint]

    "T10",  # flake8-debugger (prevent forgotten debugger statements)
    "EM",   # flake8-errmsg (improve exception message quality)

]

ignore = [
    "ANN101", # Type hint for self is unnecessary (deprecated)
    "ANN002", # Type hint for *args can be omitted
    "ANN003", # Type hint for **kwargs can be omitted
    "ANN001", # Missing type annotation for function arguments
    "ANN401", # Dynamically typed expressions are disallowed
    "ARG001", # Unused function argument
    "ARG005", # Unused lambda argument
    "PLR2004", # Magic value used in comparison
    "E501",   # Line length limit (auto-fix may not work, slows development)
    "TRY003", # Exception message too long warning (too strict for AI)
    "D",      # docstring (excluded to focus on code behavior risks. Add if needed)
    "ANN201", # Missing return type annotation for public functions
    "N806",   # Variable should be lowercase
    "PLC0415", # Import should be at top-level

    "ARG002", # Unused method argument
    "RUF043", # Pattern metacharacters not escaped in match
    "RUF059", # Unused unpacked variable
    "PLR0913", # Too many arguments in function definition
    "ANN202"  # Missing return type annotation for private functions
]

[tool.ruff.lint.per-file-ignores]
"tests/**/*.py" = ["S101"]  # Allow assert in tests

[tool.ruff.lint.mccabe]
max-complexity = 10  # Exceeding this prompts function splitting (prevent AI long functions)

[tool.ruff.lint.flake8-annotations]
suppress-dummy-args = true  # Arguments starting with _ do not require type hints

[tool.pytest.ini_options]
addopts = "--cov=dev_src --cov=src --cov-report=term-missing"
testpaths = ["tests"]

[tool.mypy]
strict = true
ignore_missing_imports = true
```

**Why These Settings Matter:**
- **Type Safety**: Strict mypy + ANN rules catch type errors before runtime
- **Complexity Control**: Max complexity of 10 prevents unmaintainable AI-generated functions
- **Security**: Bandit rules prevent common security vulnerabilities
- **Maintainability**: Enforces modern Python patterns and clean code practices


**CRITICAL:** You MUST generate EXACTLY `{{max_cycles}}` cycles. Do not decide on your own to generate fewer. If the input says 8 cycles, you must create CYCLE01 through CYCLE08.

FINAL REMINDER
DO NOT MODIFY ANY FILES except the documentation files listed above.
