Test Execution Log - CYCLE 01

Execution failed.

Reason: Unable to run tests for the `mlip_autopipec` package due to a persistent 'ModuleNotFoundError' in the testing environment. Multiple attempts to resolve the Python path issue were unsuccessful. The implemented code for `mlip_autopipec` could not be verified.

The tests for the `ac_cdd` framework were run successfully after addressing the audit feedback.
